                            Save-X Energy is Turkish based Company with offices in Istanbul, and is mainly focused in
                            the
                            developing countries of the Middle East, Africa, Asia, Central and South America where the
                            electricity networks are inadequate.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Save-X Energy Engineering Limited was founded to exploit the need for clean and green
                            energy
                            solutions to the growing need for provision of green off-grid power.
                            Save-X Energy is an environmental friendly energy producer. What makes us so inventive is
                            how
                            we look and understand Nature and it's energy.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            The sun was here from the start, it'll be there to the end, the sun powers everything that
                            grows on earth, it’s a source of energy we can trust to pwer our world today, tomorrow and
                            for
                            generations to come with no harm to our planet, it's clean, safe, and infinite.
                            It’s all about the micro inverters. Solar panels generate DC electricity and inverters turn
                            that into AC electricity, the kind of electricity your house uses. Inverters have been
                            large
                            and expensive. So there was only one per home (or business). Save-X makes a micro inverter
                            which allows the home owner (or business owner) to put an inverter on each panel. The
                            proliferation of inverters makes solar energy far more efficient and available for every
                            homeowner and business.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            With that as our guide, we have steadily grown in the energy sector and diversified our
                            productions profile to cover generating electricity from several sources and also save in
                            fuel
                            consumptions. With this in mind, Save-X Energy has developed a unique and innovative
                            solution
                            to the ongoing problem of securing easy access to cost-effective, clean sources of power.
